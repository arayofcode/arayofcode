# Helloo!

I'm Aryan, a Security Engineer by profession, problem solver at heart. Currently working in DevSecOps at [GoTo Company](https://gotocompany.com/), I have built and implemented our shift-left capabilities within all group companies. 

My team works on a vast array of projects using diverse set of tools and technologies. Currently, I use Golang, with occasional Python, and have worked with Javascript frameworks and PHP in the past. As Security Engineers, we own our projects end-to-end, and are responsible for building, testing, deploying and monitoring our projects, and hence, I keep learning more around Software Engineering, Security Engineering, DevOps, SRE, and Testing.

Being kinda-sorta curious, I take interest in topics beyond my profession and love spending time learning more about them. I also love Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and occasionally enjoy GeoGuessr. Here are some areas I've taken interest in recently:
- Finance
- Entrepreneurship (no plans of founding startups, but entrepreneurship is definitely very interesting)
- Digital Public Infrastructures

Tools and Technologies:
- Google Cloud (Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Security Engineer)
- Cryptography
- Golang, Python, PHP, Javascript

I'm always interested in meeting new people, learning about them, and exploring domains beyond tech. If you'd like to chat, you can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/aryansharma1323).

If you have any questions or need help with a security issue in my projects, please don't hesitate to open an issue in one of my repositories, and I'll do my best to help!
