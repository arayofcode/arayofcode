# Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aryan, a Security Engineer at Gojek, one of Southeast Asia's leading super apps. My work primarily revolves around DevSecOps. I'm deeply passionate about privacy and designing secure systems, always striving to look at things through a privacy lens, and try to keep myself updated with new laws around privacy. 

As a staunch believer in privacy, I view laws, technology and security through a privacy-focused perspective. 

My background in DevSecOps and Cloud Security allows me to work on an array of exciting projects. I've developed tools for Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and secret scanning, contributing to a more secure digital environment at Gojek.

Outside of work, I have a keen interest in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and occasionally enjoy GeoGuessr!
